# Stackdriver Trace (Cloud Trace)

Stackdriver Trace is a distributed tracing system that **collects latency data from your applications and diplays it in the GCP console**

You can track how requests propagate in your app and **Generate near realtime performance insights**

Stackdriver Trace can **capture performance degredations** across all your Apps

Capture traces (latency data) from
- App Engine
- HTTP(S) load balancers
- Applications instrumented with the Cloud Trace SDKs

The importance of this Stackdriver Tracing is to **ensure your applications are running at extreme scale**
