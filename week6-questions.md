## Week 6 question - July 16, 2021

1. What is the difference between CPU utilization and CPU usage metrics in Cloud Monitoring (Stackdrivre monitroing)?

2. Can you use 1 VPN gateway from your automode network in GCP to connect all your resources to another On-prem gateway? If so why does GCP say that the gateway is Regional? dont they mean that it is Global? - No GCP said you can use one Gateway to exchange traffic between many regional subnets to your on-prem gateway; Therefore VPN gateway is still regional :) 

3. Why is Cloud Router Layer 3 and not Layer 2? I thought Layer 3 connection options are restrcted to Public IP whereas layer 2 can communicate using the RFC1918 address space used in private networks and internal hosts?

Why does the type of application (stateless serving or stateful serving) matter when selecting an instance group?

Is a proxy part of the services a Loab balancer (distributed system) offers? Because they are both a buffer between Client and Server
