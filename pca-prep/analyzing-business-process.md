## Open Source tools for 
### CPU measurement
- Coremark
- Spec CPU 2006

Test apps in different zones, on different CPU architectures 
### Persistent Disk Estimation
PD performance scales with size of Disk. 

Potential IOPS may be constrained by CPU

- Bonnie++
- Copy
- Fio
- Synthetic storage

Test stress and overload conditions.

### Network capacity

Network capacity scales with the number of cores

- iperf
- Mesh
- Network
- Netperf
- Ping

### Workload estimation
Considerations for estimating workloads effectively include
- Nature/Characteristics of Commuication and Messaging
- Frequency of requests are perfromed
- Size of payload
- State changes, Sharding and Batching

Tools include:
- Aerospike
- Cassandra
- Hadoop
- HPCC
- MongoDB
