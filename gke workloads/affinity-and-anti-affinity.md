## 1. Use NodeSelector

For a Pod to run on a specific node, that node must match all the labels present under
the nodeSelector field in a Pod. NodeSelector is a Pod specification field that
specifies one or more labels.

If the nodeâ€™s labels are changed, running Pods are not affected. 
  
NodeSelector is only used during Pod scheduling

## 2. Node Affinity and Anti Affinity

Like NodeSelectors, **Node affinity also allows you to constrain which nodes your Pod
can be scheduled on, based on labels**, but the features are more expressive and can
be used to constrain against 
- the labels of both nodes and 
- other Pods running on nodes
