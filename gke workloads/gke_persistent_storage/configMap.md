# Pods refer to ConfigMap in 3 ways

## 1. Environment variable

Here, a single ConfigMap is used in the Pod as a container environment variable.
Within an env field, a container environment variable is named as VARIABLE_DEMO.
The values are retrieved using configMapKeyRef.
Multiple variables can be added from the same or different ConfigMapss

## 2. In Pod commands

## 3. By creating a Volume (Ephemeral)

In this example, a Volume named config-volume is created in the Volumes section,
with a ConfigMap named demo.
The result: a ConfigMap Volume is created for this Pod. All the data from the
ConfigMap is stored in this ConfigMap Volume as files, and then this Volume is
mounted to the container using the mountPath directory.

Each nodeâ€™s Kubelet periodically syncs with
ConfigMap to keep the ConfigMap Volume updated

When a ConfigMap Volume is already mounted and the source ConfigMap is
changed, the projected keys are **eventually** (seconds-minutes) updated

### For frequently changing configuration variables
 If you have a piece of configuration
data that will change more rapidly than that, you should probably implement a
microservice to provide its value to Pods
