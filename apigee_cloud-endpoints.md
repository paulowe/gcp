## Cloud Endpoints helps you create and maintain APIs

- Control access and validate calls with JSON Web Tokens and Google API keys
      - Identify web, mobile users with Auth0 and Firebase Authentication
- Generate client libraries   

Supports applications running on **one of GCP's compute platforms**, in your choice of language/runtime (NodeJS, Python) and your choice of clients (Android, iOS, Javascript)

## Apigee Edge helps you secure and monetize APIs
A platform for making APIs available to your customers and partners
Contains analytics, monetization, and a developer portal

## Use cases
Many users of Apigee are providing a software service to other companies.

Because **backend parts of Apigee Edge need not be in GCP**, Engineers can also use it when
taking apart legacy applications. Instead of replacing a monolithic applications in one risky move,
you can instead use Apigee edge to peel off its surfaces one by one, until the application can finally be Retired.

This is the best option for the gradual decomoposition of a pre-existing monolithic app, not implemented in GCP, into microservices
