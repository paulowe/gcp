## Compute Options (vCPU and Memory)

**You have 3 options for configuring a VM. 1. Console 2. Cloud Shell 3. REST APIs**

To automate and process complex configuriations you would want to use REST APIs to configure.

Tip: Configure desired environment using GCP Console and request for equivalent REST code to avoid typos and you get guided drop downs of available options!!

### Available Machine Types

Machine types capture your systems virtual hardware resources including
- Memory 
- vCPU and
- Persistent disk size

GCP offers several machine types in **two categories**

1. Predefined machine types: Ratio of GB of memory per vCPU
    - Standard
    - High - memory
    - High CPU
    - Memory optimized
    - Compute optimized
    - Shared - core
2. Custom machine types: Specify the amount of memory and vCPUs.
