### VPC Network
- Each VPC is contained in a GCP Project
- You can provision Cloud platform resources in VPC
- You can connect VPC - VPC
- Use Firewalls to restric access

### The VPC networks have Global Scope; Subnets are regional
- A subnet can have resources from different zones
- Can dynamically increase the size of the subnet by expanding the range of IP addresses allocated (without affecting 
  existing resources)
  
#### You can use this to build resilient solutions with simple network layout

### Quickstart
You can define your own VPC or use the default
