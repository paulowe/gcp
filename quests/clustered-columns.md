# Creating a clustered table from a query result

There are two ways to create a clustered table from a query result:

- Write the results to a new destination table and specify the clustering columns. This method is discussed below.
- By using a DDL CREATE TABLE AS SELECT statement. For more information about this method, see Creating a clustered table from the result of a query on the Using data definition language statements page.
