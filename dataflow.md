## Cloud Dataflow offers managed piplines
It is unified programming model and a managed service that enables you to execute a wide range of data processing patterns such as
- ETL
- Batch computations
- Continuous computaitons

The service **automatically scales, with no instance provisioning required**
This frees users from operational tasks such as resoure management and optimizations.

## Use cases
- Use Dataflow to build data piplines
- Batch/Realtime data
- Unpredictable size or rate

- So, with Cloud Dataflow you can build **very expressive** data piplines

- Has automated and optimized work partitioning built in, which can **dynamically rebalance lagging work**
  This reduces the need to worry about Hot keys - situations where disproportionately large chunks of your input get mapped to the same cluster
