## Cloud Dataflow offers managed piplines
It is unified programming model and a managed service that enables you to execute a wide range of **very expressive** data processing patterns such as
- ETL
- Batch computations
- Continuous computaitons

The service **automatically scales, with no instance provisioning required**
This frees users from operational tasks such as resoure management and optimizations.

Furthermore, Cloud Dataflow has automated and optimized work partitioning built in, which can **dynamically rebalance lagging work**.
This reduces the need to worry about **Hot keys** - situations where disproportionately large chunks of your input get mapped to the same cluster

## Use cases
- Use Dataflow to build data piplines
- Batch/Realtime data
- Unpredictable size or rate
